## Project Overview

   This project provides temperature data from the Hawaiian island of Oahu for the months of June and December. The temperature data will help determine the business sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. 
 
## Results

##### [Statistical Data for Oahu Temperature in ***June***](https://github.com/fmgribbon/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/JuneStats.PNG)
- The temperature data for Oahu in June:
    - Average temperature: 75°F 
    - Temperature Range: 64°F - 85°F 
    - Difference between average and lowest temperature : 11°F
    - Difference between average and highest temperature: 10°F  

##### [Statistical Data for Oahu Temperature in ***December***](https://github.com/fmgribbon/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/DecStats.PNG)
- The temperature data for Oahu in December:
	- Average temperature: 71°F
	- Temperature Range: 56°F – 83°F 
	- Difference between ave. and lowest temperature : 15°F    
    - Difference between ave. and highest temperature: 12°F  

##### Temperature Differences from June to December:
- Average temperature: 4°F drop
- Difference between the average and lowest temperature: December  higher than June
- The difference in average temperature and highest: December slightly higher than June
- Standard Deviation: half of a point difference
  
### Summary

The data analysis revealed a slight differences in all the statistical measures from June to December.

To achieve a better understanding of how one of the factors, climate changes, could affect the business sustainability of the Surf and ice cream shop, two more data analyses should be done, namely:
 -  Analysis on the precipitation in the months of June and December
 - Analysis on the temperature and precipitation for the month of June and December including the time of day the data was recorded.
 
These analyses will reveal the influence of precipitation and climate change in the influx of tourist and surfers during the months of June and December. The results could help predict and develop a plan for the surge and decline in visitors.
